        <h1>VEHICLE RECALL NOTICE</h1>
        <h2>WARNING</h2>
        <h3>One or more vehicles that you own are under recall.</h3>

        <h4>AFFECTED VEHICLES</h4>
        <div class="vehicle_list">
            <table id="vehicle_table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Vehicle</th>
                    <th>License Plate</th>

        <h4>POSSIBLE REASONS FOR THIS RECALL</h4>
        <p>Vehicles can be recalled for the following reasons: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Significant body and visual defects caused by the manufacturer that cannot be easily fixed</li>
            <li>Cosmetic issues that cause people to see artifacts or flickering when standing nearby</li>
            <li>Model is oversized and has a polygon or vertices count that exceeds normal limits* (L0 of 200k+).</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?</h4>
        <p>You are receiving this notice because you are the registered owner of one or more vehicle(s) listed above.
            Please review the entire notice letter in full and take the recommended actions.
        </p>

        <h4>RECOMMENDED ACTION</h4>
        <p>Vehicles under recall are subject to a complete removal a minimum of <b>14 days</b> from the initial recall
            date. If you are receiving this notice, please return the vehicles listed above to the dealership
            immediately. This can be done in the purple parking circle behind PDM: 200 Adams Apple Blvd.
            Currently,
            the residual value on recalled vehicles is <b>70%</b> for ones originally purchased as a supporter vehicle,
            and <b>50%</b> for non-supporter vehicles. This figure is subject to change at the sole
            discretion of
            the recall authority. <u>Failure to return the vehicle within the recommended
                time frame will result in a complete loss of the vehicle with no recourse for the registered
                owner.</u>
        </p>

        <h4>WHY IS 'X' VEHICLE BEING RECALLED?</h4>
        <p>Over the past few
            months, there have been numerous complaints of freezes, frame drops, hangs, stuttering, and
            other <i>client</i> performance issues in populated areas with a lot of player owned vehicles. These issues
            are unacceptable and are being addressed with the recall system. One of our top priorities is to provide the
            smoothest experience for everyone regardless
            of any hardware considerations. The goal is
            to slowly reduce the number of
            problematic vehicles on the road, which will lead to a noticeable improvement in player experience over
            time.
            Note that these improvements will be gradual and manifest over the long run, when the number of recalled
            vehicles gets reduced to zero.
        </p>

        <h4>CAN A RECALLED VEHICLE BE TRADED IN FOR ANOTHER VEHICLE AT THE DEALERSHIP?</h4>
        <p>No. Vehicles that are under recall cannot be exchanged as the issue is with the vehicle model itself being
            defective or oversized. Recall costs are covered by the federal government and are not issued by the
            dealership.</p>

        <h4>DO I NEED SUPPORTER STATUS TO RETURN A RECALLED VEHICLE?</h4>
        <p>No. Vehicles under recall can be sold back to PDM regardless of supporter status or whether the vehicle was
            originally purchased as a supporter vehicle. This is done to ensure everyone has a fair chance to return
            recalled vehicles..</p>

        <h4>IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT CAN BE DONE INSTEAD?</h4>
        <p>No. Vehicles that are under recall cannot be registered, sold, or transferred to other players. The recall
            system was
            introduced to provide a fair and uniform process for anyone who owns a recalled
            vehicle. Do <b>NOT</b> attempt to contact the recall authority or any government officials, there is
            nothing that can be done on an individual basis.</p>

        <h1>COMMUNITY SERVICE ISSUED</h1>
        <h2>NOTICE</h2>
        <h3>You were issued community service as a punishment by the staff team.</h3>

        <h4>REASON FOR COMMUNITY SERVICE</h4>
        <p>You were issued community service for the following reason: </p>
        <p id="comserv_reason"></p>

        <h4>WHAT IS COMMUNITY SERVICE?</h4>
        <p>The staff team can, at their discretion, issue community service to players found in violation of the server
            rules. </p>

        <h4>WHO HAS THE AUTHORITY TO ISSUE COMMUNITY SERVICE?</h4>
        <p>Community service can be issued by any staff member (regardless of job) or a whitelisted job holder, provided
            they are on duty and within the limits of their job. If you are receiving this notice, your sentence was
            issued by the staff team -- NOT by a whitelisted job. Community service issued by a whitelisted job is
            considered a non-staff punishment and does not appear on your record.</p>

        <h4>HOW DO I COMPLETE MY SERVICE?</h4>
        <p>Players who are issued community service must complete actions by sweeping the beach. One month is equal to
            one action of service. Find the appropriate locations and follow the instructional message.
        </p>

        <h4>I BELIEVE THIS WAS INCORRECTLY ISSUED. WHAT RECOURSE DO I HAVE?</h4>
        <p>If you believe this was issued in error, open a #create-ticket on Discord (discord.gg/cityofla) and explain your
            reasoning. Do NOT place assists regarding your community service or you will be assist blacklisted. Copy and
            paste the entire contents of this notice when submitting an appeal to reduce or remove your sentence.</p>
